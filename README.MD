# Oric Char

A script to convert spritesheet images into Oric characters, in assembly.

## Features

- Converts monochrome spritesheet images into Oric-compatible character data.
- Outputs data in assembly format (`.db` statements).
- Supports configurable character width and height.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
- [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)

Install dependencies with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
python oric-char.py input_image.png output.s [-W WIDTH] [-H HEIGHT]
```

- `input_image.png`: Input monochrome image file (e.g., PNG).
- `output.s`: Output assembly file.
- `-W WIDTH`: Character width in byte columns (default: 1).
- `-H HEIGHT`: Character height in pixel rows (default: 8).

### Example

```
python oric-char.py example.png chars.s -W 2 -H 8
```

This will convert `example.png` into Oric character data, with each character being 2 bytes wide and 8 pixels high, and write the result to `chars.s`.

## Output Format

The output file contains `.db` statements for each character, with binary values and a visual ASCII representation as comments.

## Notes

- The input image should be monochrome (black=1 and white=0).
- Each character is extracted from the image grid according to the specified width and height.
